molsim is a GNU Octave/Matlab toolbox for molecular dynamics simulations. molsim supports simulations of
- simple Lennard-Jones systems,
- molecular systems with bond, angle, and torsion potentials,
- confined flow systems, eg., Couette and Poiseuille flows,
- charged systems using shifted force and Wolf methods,
- dissipative particle dynamics systems,
- different ensembles,
- and more . .
