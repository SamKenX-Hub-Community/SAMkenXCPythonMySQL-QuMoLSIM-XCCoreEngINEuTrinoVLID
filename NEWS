molsim-0.9.0
------------

Initial release for molsim - molecular simulations in GNU Octave

With this release: Wrapper for large part of the seplib functionality.
Allows simulations of

  * Standard Lennard-Jones systems
  * Molecular systems (bonds, angle, torsion angle)
  * Charged systems using the shifted force and Wolf methods 
  * Confined systems (eg slit-pores)
  * Thermostats
  * DPD simulations
  * Run-time sampling 
  * Simple setup

molsim-0.9.1
------------

  * Important memory leak fix.
  * Added molecular configurations

molsim-0.9.2
------------

  * Barostat implementet
  * First version of tutorial  
  * Bug fixes
  * More example scripts/functions

molsim-0.9.3 
------------

  * Added 'convert' action 
  * Molecular stress calculations now supported under parallisation 
  * Added more specifiers to get: 'molvelocities', 'indices' 
  * Revision to tutorial
  * Changed actions 'thermostate' and 'barostate' to
    'thermostat' and 'barostat'

molsim-0.9.4
------------

  * Added more specifiers to action 'get': 'charges',
    'bondlengths', 'angles' and 'torsions'
  * Action 'compress' now allows anisotropic compression
  * Optimization to sf-Coulomb interaction calculations (seplib)
  * Revisions/update to tutorial
  * Bug squashing 
  * Initial version of a test script

molsim-0.9.5 
------------

  * A few bug fixes (thanks to Kai's compiler for pointing out these issues)
  * Added 'dihedral' specifier for to the calcforce action (alternative to 'torsion')
  * Minor update to tutorial
  * Re-arrangement of the test suit and addition of some more tests (still a bit messy)
  * Added a release checklist

molsim-0.11.0
-------------

  * Added GJF Langevin integrator (seplib)
  * Minor updates to tutorial
  * Documentation of resource files (will later be present in tutorial)
  * Compiler flag "-march=native" default (gcc only) 
  * Nose-Hoover?
