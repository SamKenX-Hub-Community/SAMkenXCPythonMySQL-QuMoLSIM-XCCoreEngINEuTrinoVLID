Initial release for molsim - molecular simulations in GNU Octave

With this release:

Wrapper for large part of the seplib functionality.
Allows simulations of

  * Standard Lennard-Jones systems
  * Molecular systems (bonds, angle, dihedrals)
  * Charged systems using the shifted force method 
  * Confined systems (eg slit-pores)
  * Thermostats
  * DPD simulations
  * Run-time Sampling 
  * Simple setup

See 'molsim.pdf' reference quick sheet
(installed in package directory under doc/).
