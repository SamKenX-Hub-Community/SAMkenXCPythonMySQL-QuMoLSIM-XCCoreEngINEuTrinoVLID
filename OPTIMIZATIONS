This file lists the optimization attempts and implimentaton

1: openmp for-loop parallization in pair force interactions. Reduction on force array +
   dynamic scheduling. Implemented.

2: openmp for-loop parallization in bond, angle, and dihedral angle force calculuations.
   Reduction on force array + dynamic scheduling. No effect, not implemented

3: Timing using the seplib atom data structure or simple array data structure shows no effect, not
   implimented.
